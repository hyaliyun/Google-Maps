## Terra Draw

Frictionless map drawing across mapping libraries.

Terra Draw centralizes map drawing logic and provides a host of out-of-the-box drawing modes that work across different JavaScript mapping libraries. It also allows you to bring your own modes!



### Library Support

Terra Draw uses the concept of 'adapters' to allow it to work with a host of different mapping libraries. Currently supported are:

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) v1
- [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) v10
- [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs) v2
- [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/) v2/v3
- [Google Maps JS API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) v3
- [ArcGIS JavaScript SDK](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/) v4 (MapView)
