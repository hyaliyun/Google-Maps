# Dawarich

## Screenshots

Dawarich is a self-hosted web application to replace Google Timeline (aka Google Location History). It allows you to import your location history from Google Maps Timeline and Owntracks, view it on a map and see some statistics, such as the number of countries and cities visited, and distance traveled.

You can find changelog [here](CHANGELOG.md).

## Disclaimer

⚠️ The project is under very active development.

⚠️ Expect bugs and breaking changes.

⚠️ Do not delete your original Google Maps
Timeline data after importing it to Dawarich.

⚠️ Export your data from Dawarich using built-in
export functionality before updating to a new version.

⚠️ Try to keep Dawarich up-to-date to have the latest features and bug fixes.

## Usage

Following sources of live data are supported:

- [Overland](https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/track-your-location#overland)
- [OwnTracks](https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/track-your-location#owntracks)
- [GPSLogger](https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/track-your-location#gps-logger)
- [Home Assistant](https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/track-your-location#homeassistant)

To track your location, install the [Owntracks app](https://owntracks.org/booklet/guide/apps/) or [Overland app](https://overland.p3k.app/) on your phone and configure it to send location updates to your Dawarich instance.

### OwnTracks

The url to send the location updates to is `http://<your-dawarich-instance>/api/v1/owntracks/points?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`.

Currently, the app only supports [HTTP mode](https://owntracks.org/booklet/tech/http/) of OwnTracks.

### Overland

The url to send the location updates to is `http://<your-dawarich-instance>/api/v1/overland/batches?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`.

Your API key can be found and/or generated in the user settings.

To import your Google Maps Timeline data, download your location history from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) and upload it to Dawarich.
