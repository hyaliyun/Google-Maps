Start working with encrypted files in Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides
All files uploaded to Drive or created in Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are encrypted using AES256-bit encryption, both in transit and in storage . For added confidentiality, your organization can allow users to encrypt Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides files using Workspace client-side encryption. Encrypted files have some limitations compared to regular files. You can also upload any type of Drive file, such as PDFs and Office files, as encrypted Drive files.

Important : To encrypt Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides files using Workspace client-side encryption:

You must have a Workspace account.
Your administrator must enable client-side encryption.
You must verify your identity.

Understanding encryption
Encryption is the process of encoding information for data protection. For users to create or copy encrypted files, they must verify their identity and their administrator must enable Workspace client-side encryption. An encrypted file can be accessed by anyone you share it with using the file's unique encryption key. Google normally encrypts content in transit and at rest, but using client-side encryption adds an extra layer of security to your domain.

Things to know about encryption
Your domain administrator can control which groups and individuals can use encryption. If you want to move files to a location with encryption turned on, or turn it on for a new location, contact your administrator .
Admins can also choose to recommend that users use client-side encryption for new files in Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides via an in-app prompt. Check with your admin as needed to make sure you understand expectations for your organization.
Client-side encryption adds an extra layer of security to your organization. Your files are encrypted end-to-end as they travel between clients. Google cannot decrypt your files. Things to note:
An application with sufficient permissions on your computer, such as a Chrome extension, may be able to view and exfiltrate encrypted files.
Encryption does not prevent others from viewing your screen.
How often you need to log in again to open client-side encrypted files is determined by your administrator. If you need to log in frequently, contact your administrator.
Understanding the Differences in Encrypted Files
Encrypted files will have a lock icon next to them .
Encrypted files allow only one user to edit them at a time. Learn how to collaborate on encrypted files .
In encrypted files, autosave occurs every 30 seconds unless your device is idle or performing other actions (such as sharing the file or attempting to exit the file).
If you try to exit an unsaved file, you will be warned. To avoid losing unsaved changes, click Cancel .
The auto-save function has 3 states:
Pending Save : The system waits for the conditions that trigger an automatic save to occur or for the 30-second timer to expire.
Saving : The system is saving. You can continue editing the file.
Saved to Drive : You haven't made any changes. Your version is up to date.
You can create an encrypted file in a number of different ways. Learn how to create or copy an encrypted file .
To access encrypted files, your administrator might require you to log in to two additional single sign-on (SSO) services: once with your organization's identity provider and once with Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides.
You can print from Google Docs or Sheets, but not from Google Slides.
Spell checking for encrypted documents and slides supports American English, British English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.
Tables do not support spell checking.
You can export a Google Sheets file to an Excel file. Click on the file Then click to download .
The version history of encrypted files can be kept up to 100 versions. After 100 versions, the system automatically removes less important versions. Named versions are not currently supported.
Encrypted Docs, Sheets, and Slides have a size limit of 100 MB. Encrypted Drive files have no limit.
The maximum number of images in a document is 3,000.
The maximum size for a single image is 1 MB.
Download folders do not affect client-side encrypted files.
